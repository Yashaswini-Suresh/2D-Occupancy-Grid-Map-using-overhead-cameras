# 2D-Occupancy-Grid-Map-using-overhead-cameras
 This project aims to develop a 2D occupancy grid map of a room using overhead cameras. The main objective is to create a real-time representation of the environment, distinguishing between occupied and free spaces. This map can be useful for various applications such as robotic navigation, room monitoring, and space utilization analysis.
